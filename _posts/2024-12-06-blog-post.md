# UnitedHealthcare Leadership Webpages Offline in Aftermath of CEO Death

It’s Wednesday, December 4th 2024, 6:48 a.m., NYPD officers have just arrived at a 911 call location where they find Brian R. Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare; lifeless on a sidewalk. He is pronounced dead 24 minutes later.

Six 9mm rounds were recovered at the scene, three live and three fired. Three of the six rounds had words written onto their shells: “Deny”, “Defend”, and “Depose”.

I’m sure the rounds were not found in that very convenient order, but they have been reported in that specific way because of one book by the name of “Delay, Deny, Defend”. The amazon listing for the paperback describes itself as “An expose of insurance injustice and a plan for consumers and lawmakers to fight back.” The last word on the rounds was also changed out, instead of “Delay”, the rounds swap out the wording to “Depose”, which means “[to] remove from office suddenly and forcefully”, making a double entendre not even Drake could ever hope to write.

Over the next few hours, the news of Thompson's death would cause a country-wide outage of web pages that list the CEOs and board members for well-known healthcare and insurance companies. The timeline of changes for these (now offline) web pages have been captured by the Wayback Machine.

The timeline for the website takedowns didn't begin with UnitedHealthcare, but I will show you their website takedown as an example.
