Uh. Hey, you’re late for mass.
PREACHER
I’m not sure if I think there is
even a God anymore. I mean, I’ve
been praying to him for over 40
years and not one of my prayers
were answered. God doesn’t exist!
CHRIS
Is that true dad?
PETER
No Chris. Of course there is a God.
But you have to see it from his
point of view.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
I mean, if you think about it, God
is basically watching us like a TV
show. Do you honestly think he can
sit there for over 4,000 years
watching the same thing? God only
knows what he’s doing now.
CAMERA PULLS UP INTO THE SKY, THROUGH THE CLOUDS, REVEALING
HEAVEN WHERE GOD AND JESUS ARE PLAYING FOOSBALL. IN THE

NO DIVINE POWERS”. GOD SCORES ANOTHER GOAL ON JESUS.

Oh! Hell yes! I win again. Who’s
your Daddy?! Come on, say it! Who’s
your Daddy?
JESUS
You’re my daddy!
GOD
Hell yeah!

So you see? God exists. Just
because he doesn’t answer your

exist. He could just be in the can.
PREACHER
(Calm.)
Geez, Peter. I never thought of it
that way. Thank you.
The Preacher stands up.

So then you’re going in there to

Connie Domico invited me over to
her house for a slumber party
because she’s celebrating because
she got accepted to the college she
wanted, then, Craig Hoffman asked
me out again, and this time it
means more to me because I’m myself
and not the product of some
desperate makeover.
